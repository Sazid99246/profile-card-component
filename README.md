## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### Continued development

However, I couldn't add the corner backgrounds that are shown in the design. I am currently searching for how to do that. If you know, please give me a hand.

### Useful resources

- [CSS background image size 50%](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19747634/css-background-image-size-50) - This helped me to find the background-size property for the pattern-background.
- [background-size on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size) - This is the actual place where I learned how to use the background-size property.
